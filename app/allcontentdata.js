        text: 'The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) works around the world to help eradicate poverty, reduce inequality and exclusion, and make development sustainable. With decades of experience and our target of ensuring inclusive growth, environmental sustainability, democratic governance, and common security, we provide expertise that supports countries in meeting their development goals and ensuring that all parts of society are included.<br /><br />UNDP’s governance and peacebuilding work is a key part of this development agenda. We help to strengthen representative governance and the rule of law, make politics and institutions inclusive and accountable, and reduce the risk of violence, which in turn encourages open societies which foster inclusive growth. <img class="c-inclusive-growth-logo-1180" src="Content/images/sust-goals-logo-1180px.png" alt="Sustainable Development Goals" /> Given its recent history, governance and peacebuilding is particularly important in Europe and Central Asia. Operating from a wide network of country offices as well as the regional hub in Istanbul, UNDP is able to help effectively manage complexity and mitigate the risk of conflict and violence.<br /><br /> In 2015, our work took on a new significance with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2030 Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity that also seeks to promote peace, justice and freedom. Together, the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda require all countries and stakeholders to take the bold and transformative steps urgently required to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.<br /><br /> Over the next fifteen years, countries will mobilize efforts to achieve the SDGs, guided by a specific set of targets provided for each SDG. The targets under SDG 16 - Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies and SDG 5 – Ensuring gender equality and women’s empowerment will be integrated into UNDP’s support for governance and peacebuilding. <br/><br/>This platform highlights UNDP’s contribution to governance and peacebuilding in Europe and Central Asia, towards achieving SDGs 16 & 5. It will provide an up-to-date picture of how UNDP works with countries to promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies.',

It has developed a range of tools in these contexts to drive an increasingly analytical and evidence-based approach, and has cultivated a strong knowledge base in effective programming that ranges from conflict-sensitive approaches to area-based development to more active work using development assistance to foster confidence in protracted conflict situations. The development mandate provides UNDP with political neutrality and substantial operational capacities to deliver development solutions in these challenging environments. <br /><br />Based on this extensive experience, UNDP’s approach has two key dimensions: <br /><ul><li>	Accurately identify and assess development needs and priorities at the local level, in order to effectively target assistance, and thus adhere to core principles of conflict sensitivity, including the ‘do no harm’ philosophy; and</li><li>Directly engage with and facilitate inclusive participation of people at the community level in decision-making, to focus on addressing shared challenges and development issues at the inter-community level, irrespective of the higher level political context.</li></ul> <br />A key pillar in UNDP’s conflict analysis and risk assessment work, as well as conflict and peacebuilding programming more generally, is the deployment of Peace and Development Advisors, with the UNDP-DPA Joint Programme on Building National Capacities for Conflict Prevention being the primary facilitator of these deployments. This global programme enables access to a global network of specialized expertise at the local level, helping Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams analyse, adapt and respond to complex political development with conflict-sensitive programming. In 2015, Peace and Development Advisors were deployed in eight countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. <br /><br />UNDP also has a number of other partners in its conflict analysis and risk assessment work. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has deployed Human Rights Advisors to provide guidance on navigating politically complex situations where human rights violations are in question and the Human Rights Up-Front mechanism has reviewed risks in specific countries in the region. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has also been an important and long-term partner in this work across the region.',

                            text: 'In most of the region’s protracted conflicts, the situation has worsened considerably over the course of 2015 and 2016. In some cases, such as Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, long-standing political processes have ground to virtual stalemate. In others, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the protracted conflicts have returned to open combat. In eastern Ukraine, the conflict continues to simmer dangerously, with violence at times escalating significantly. Within this increasingly polarized regional and international environment, the number of actors considered “impartial” has continued to decrease, having the unfortunate overall effect of further isolating these communities and making the situation for already-vulnerable communities that much more precarious.<br /><br />In recognition of the fact that delivering basic welfare and livelihood-improving assistance requires careful political calibration, throughout the course of 2015, UNDP continued to strengthen its joint work with DPA. This work focuses on supporting UN Country Teams with Peace and Development Advisors that assist UN programming in these highly sensitive conditions – including in BiH, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine. <br /><br />In BiH, at a time of heightened social tension between youth and the Government, and with considerable residual inter-ethnic divisions, the Dialogue for the Future programme opened up a new form of structured dialogue between young people and the (mainly older) members of the Government about what type of future citizens want for their country, as well as nation-wide opportunities to promote intercultural understanding and dialogue. The project went on to support a number of innovative initiatives that corresponded with this vision. <br /><br /> In Georgia, at a time of reduced dialogue between Tbilisi and Sukhumi, the highly political and long-stalled project to resurface the Enguri Bridge – the principal connection between communities separated by conflict and living on both sides of the Enguri River, was finally agreed. This has allowed for contact to be re-established, families to be reunited and a reduction in operational obstacles for businesses.<br /><br />In the fertile Fergana Valley between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, UNDP’s long-standing area-based work in ethnically-divided communities, where violent clashes are frequent, intensified and expanded to embed a community-owned early warning system. This system uses metrics to alert community leaders to deteriorating conditions and allows for targeted development assistance to be provided to those leaders, facilitating community-level decisions that can lead to community-level projects. Early indicators demonstrate that tensions and violent clashes are reducing as a result. <div class="c-allimg-wrap c-right"><div class="c-img-box"><img src="Content/images/photos-and-graphic/image-20-1.jpg" alt="Example image" /><div class="c-img-desc"><div class="c-table"><div class="c-cell">Resurfacing the Enguri Bridge, the principal connection between the territory of Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia</div></div></div></div><div class="c-img-sign">Photo by: UNDP Georgia</div></div>All of this work has been enabled by an increasingly functional Joint Programme between DPA and UNDP delivering development assistance in areas beset by division and conflict.'

In particular, UNDP and DPA work together closely to support the UN Country Teams in a growing number of challenging socio-economic, governance and peace and security settings. Some of these challenges include latent, deep-rooted and unresolved inter-ethnic and/or religious tensions; tensions related to disputed territories or unresolved or protracted conflicts undermining peace and security; democratic governance deficit and adverse impact of global trends, including migration, transnational crime and violent extremism. As evidence of this support to UN Country Teams, we can point to our close cooperation in developing coordinated, UN system-wide responses to politically-sensitive events, including election-related violence, constitutional reviews efforts and legislative changes that may contribute to political instability.<br /> <br />The UNDP- DPA partnership helps bringing together the UN’s political and development capacities in more efficient and effective ways to address such challenges.The partnership has augmented the capacity of the UN to carry out its mandates for early warning/ early action, conflict prevention, mediation, peace-building, reconciliation, promotion of dialogue and development and helps to reinforce the UNCT’s ability to work with relevant Member States and to send coherent messages at critical moments. These increased efforts often take place within the framework of the UNDP-DPA Joint Programme to support strengthening national capacities for conflict prevention, which uses various tools, including the deployment of Peace and Development Advisors, in several countries of the ECIS, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Tajikistan.',

However, with oil and other petroleum products making up over 60 percent of exports, the fall in prices for many commodities in 2015 had a significant impact on the Kazakh economy.<br /><br /> In April 2015, Nursultan Nazarbaev won the latest presidential election with a reported 97.7 percent of the vote.    <sup class="c-sup-popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-toggle="popover" data-content="<a href=\'http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32471428/\' target=\'_blank\'>BBC News, “Kazakh leader gains crushing election victory”, 27 April 2015.</a>">1</sup> His re-election coincided with the launch of an important reform process, entitled ‘100 Concrete Steps to Implement Five Institutional Reforms’, which is anticipated to strongly impact on institutional efficiency, government openness and long-term economic development. Furthermore, the President has made a commitment to reforms encouraging a multi-party system, while the country has also been exploring ways to decentralize power to the local level, with several initiatives from the Government in this area. To date, however, there is still significant potential for the further decentralization of power to local executive bodies. <br /><br />  Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan has implemented significant public administration and civil service reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government. Nonetheless, more progress is needed in addressing the development challenges facing Kazakhstan. Restrictions on freedom of expression remain, with newspapers and other media outlets presenting dissenting views still subject to closure by authorities. Further improvement is also required to reduce discrimination against ethnic minorities, the LGTBI community and some religious groups. <br /><br /> More recently, Kazakhstan has been playing an active role in attempts to counter violent extremism in Central Asia. In June 2015, Kazakhstan hosted the two-day Central and South Asia Regional Conference on Countering Violent Extremism. Co-organized by the Kazakh and US governments, the event was attended by 200 high-level government officials, representatives of the private sector and civil society activists from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. As a result of the conference, a set of recommendations were adopted and concrete steps proposed to enhance national and regional efforts.'

UNDP has been involved with this new law in several ways, including participating in the working group to discuss and draft the law, providing expert recommendations and advice, and the provision of suggestions and comments collected at Regulatory Impact Analysis and capacity building events in the regions. Following the drafting process, UNESCO and UNDP also initiated a preliminary evaluation of the draft law to assess compliance with the Global Right to Information index. The results of this evaluation were presented in September by the UN common group at the ‘Access to Information and Public Participation’ conference organized by the Parliament, OSCE, UNDP and a number of NGO partners.   <div class="c-allimg-wrap c-right"><div class="c-img-box"><img src="Content/images/photos-and-graphic/image-kazakhstan-99-1.jpg" alt="Example image" /><div class="c-img-desc"><div class="c-table"><div class="c-cell">Discussing the effectiveness of public councils, the involvement of civil society in decision making and access to information</div></div></div></div><div class="c-img-sign">Photo by: UNDP Kazakhstan</div></div>  UNDP also continued its support for the Regional Hub for Civil Service in Astana (the Hub). Established in 2013, the Hub’s goal is to promote civil service excellence and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best practices among the countries of the region and beyond. The Hub has a range of strategies, including capacity building for people and institutions, building partnerships and networks across borders, and assisting with research and knowledge management. As part of this support, in 2015, UNDP assisted with the launch of the Innovative Solutions Scheme, a grants scheme that supports innovative reforms and solutions in civil service and public administration that have the potential to be replicated in other countries. UNDP also sits on the independent selection committee that selects the most innovative proposals. Membership of the Hub currently includes 36 countries globally. <br /><br />  In work to support the strengthening of the rule of law and human rights, UNDP completed a nationwide survey of 12,206 people in 193 courts to provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the judicial system. The survey results have been made public and posted on the website of the Supreme Court. Further, UNDP worked in partnership with the Supreme Court and OHCHR to deliver regional workshops targeted at judges, prosecutors, policemen and local government representatives to increase knowledge on how UN treaty bodies function, and facilitate discussion on the need for better coordination between government agencies. <br /><br /> Despite high levels of female participation in the work force, women in Kazakhstan continue to suffer from discrimination in many aspects of life. In efforts to change the perception of women in Kazakhstan, UNDP is supporting a dialogue on ways to promote the protection of the rights of women and children, and the right to education of young girls, as outlined in the strategy ‘Kazakhstan – 2050’ <br /> <br /> <h3 class="c-align-center">FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION, KAZAKHSTAN VS.

                text: 'While Kazakhstan continues to make improvements in the field of civil service reform and public services delivery, several challenges remain.  <br /><br /> Despite the Government’s willingness to promote state transparency and accountability, the implementation of the new laws on Access to Information and Public Councils have so far proven difficult, with a lack of supplementary regulations for the practical application of laws, and some government officials yet to be convinced of the benefits. The successful implementation of these laws is expected to require significant capacity building and experience before yielding results. Going forward, this work to improve transparency and accountability of civil servants and government bodies will be coordinated with the lower house of Parliament (the Majilis) and OSCE to ensure continued respect for the constitutional rights of people to obtain and disseminate information, and take part in decision-making processes. <br /><br />  UNDP’s work with the Hub will continue. In particular, UNDP will support the development of a long-term strategy for the Hub, factoring in the needs of the participating countries. The results of this process will be recorded in operational and strategy documents. With a long-term strategy in place, support and training will be provided on how to best develop the Hub’s facilities and resources in line with that strategy.<br /><br /> Work to improve public administration will also be taken to the regions, where UNDP will support efforts to improve the capacities of public councils. Specifically, UNDP will be working with members of public councils, NGOs, the media and representatives of local executive bodies to support the effective use of public hearings, public expertise, public monitoring and reporting of executives at public councils’ meetings. UNDP will also look to build on the recent events around countering violent extremism to encourage proactive measures to reduce extremism that do not negatively impact on human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, UNDP will continue supporting the efforts of the Government in development of local governance, with a law on local governance expected to be passed in the near future.<br /><br /> Finally, UNDP will continue assisting the Government in its efforts to improve and implement human rights legislation, taking on board the recommendations provided through the UN treaty bodies’ mechanisms. This will include the development of indicators to enable effective monitoring of the implementation of the new legislation, as well as capacity building workshops for law enforcement bodies and NGOs to increase awareness on the specifics of international commitments and mechanisms. Public discussion of human rights issues through public councils at the regional level are also planned to increase awareness on existing problems amongst LGUs and civil society.'
